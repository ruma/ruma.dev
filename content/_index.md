### What is Matrix?

Matrix is an open specification for an online communication protocol. It
includes all the features you'd expect from a modern chat platform including
instant messaging, group chats, audio and video calls, searchable message
history, synchronization across all your devices, and end-to-end encryption.
Matrix is federated, so no single company controls the system or your data. You
can use an existing server you trust or run your own, and the servers
synchronize messages seamlessly. Learn more in the [Introduction to Matrix][].

### What is Rust?

Rust is a systems programming language from Mozilla built with safety,
concurrency, and performance in mind. Its novel approach to memory safety and
its rich type system make it an excellent choice for writing fast, secure, and
reliable programs. Learn more at [www.rust-lang.org][].
