    <h2 id="from-the-editor">From the editor</h2>
<p>In addition to the changes to <code>ruma</code> enumerated below, there was some great progress on the future user-facing documentation for Ruma.
My partner, who works as a technical writer, helped me brainstorm and outline what information people would need to understand Matrix and Ruma, how to get a copy of Ruma, configure it, and deploy it.
As always, needing to explain something simply to someone else forces you to understand it at a deeper level yourself.
I think the project is going to benefit greatly from some longer form explanations of of the what, why, and how of Matrix that aren't targeted at technical people.</p>
<h2 id="notable-changes-to-ruma">Notable changes to <code>ruma</code></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Usage of the <code>try!</code> macro has been converted to using the new question mark syntax.</p>
<p>Use of this unstable feature is one nice benefit of Ruma targeting nightly Rust.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added support for authentication with an access token.</p>
<p>This is the mechanism which almost all endpoints that require authentication use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added the <code>/logout</code> endpoint which revokes all access tokens associated with the user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added the <code>/account/password</code> endpoint which lets the user change their account password.</p>
<p>This endpoint uses both user-interactive authentication and access token authentication.
The reasons for this were not clear to me, so I discussed it in #matrix-dev:matrix.org, and was able to distill the results of the discussion into <a href="https://matrix.org/jira/browse/SPEC-407">SPEC-407</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moved and renamed various free functions into static methods on the types that they manipulate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Filled in some missing API documentation and added the <code>#![deny(missing_docs)]</code> attribute to make sure docs are added as new items are.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="matrix-at-large">Matrix at large</h2>
<p>This week there was a story posted to Hacker News about how Google failed to recognize the value of Gchat, which resulted in the usual discussion of chat services that exist today.
I left a comment encouraging people to look at Matrix, and it generated a good amount of discussion and publicity for the project.
