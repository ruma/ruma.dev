    <h2 id="from-the-editor">From the editor</h2>
<p>In the <a href="/news/this-week-in-ruma-2019-07-07/">last update</a>, I mentioned that the ongoing ruma-events revamp was impeded by an issue with types from <em>ring</em> which don't implement <code>Clone</code> and <code>PartialEq</code>.
It turns out that there is <a href="https://github.com/briansmith/ring/pull/727">a reasonable explanation for this</a>, and so it was decided to work around it.
I restructured the ruma-signatures types in question so that they don't contain <em>ring</em> types, but simply construct them and use them as-needed in the relevant methods.</p>
<p>While I was working on ruma-signatures, I decided to fill in the missing functionality—signing and verifying events.
In the process of doing that, I ended up with a significantly revised API for the crate, which has now been released as <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma-signatures/releases/tag/0.5.0">version 0.5.0</a>.
In a somewhat amusing development, the new ruma-signatures API doesn't include the <code>Signatures</code> and <code>SignatureSet</code> types that were causing the issue in ruma-events in the first place.
As a result, ruma-events is not only unblocked, but doesn't have depend on ruma-signatures at all.</p>
<p>I made a little bit more progress on ruma-events.
There is only one module remaining to be updated to the new API, so we're on the home stretch for a new ruma-events release.</p>
