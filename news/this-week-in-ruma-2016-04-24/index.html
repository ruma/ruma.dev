    <h2 id="from-the-editor">From the editor</h2>
<p>I said last week that there wouldn't be an update this week because I'm on vacation, but as it turns out a bit of progress was made before I left and I have a few minutes to make the update while my partner writes postcards to send back home.</p>
<h2 id="notable-changes-to-ruma">Notable changes to <code>ruma</code></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Add initial stub implementation of user-interactive authentication.</p>
<p>Matrix's interactive auth system is in a bit of a transition, so there has been lots of investigation and discussion with the core team to learn how it works.
I was able to make some good progress on how it will be represented as Rust code, but there are many more changes to come.
I hope to have &quot;dummy&quot; authentication working soon.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="matrix-at-large">Matrix at large</h2>
<p>Many of my questions about the specification have been answered, thanks to Richard van der Hoff of the Matrix core team.
A few issues are ongoing, but all of this discussion will be very helpful in improving the specification and clarifying some flows so that Ruma can implement them.</p>
<p>Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://matrix.org/jira/browse/SPEC-385">SPEC-385</a>: PUT requests should use the JSON body for all request parameters</p>
<p>Came to agreement that, at least for the <code>/register</code> API endpoint, request parameters related to the registration should not be split arbitrarily across the query string and the body of the request.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://matrix.org/jira/browse/SPEC-343">SPEC-343</a>: Explain the purpose of refresh tokens</p>
<p>Clarified why Matrix authentication involves both &quot;access tokens&quot; and &quot;refresh tokens,&quot; where implementations are free to make their own choices, and the trade offs involved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://matrix.org/jira/browse/SPEC-313">SPEC-313</a>: Provide a high level overview of the different event syncing API endpoints</p>
<p>Ongoing discussion of which APIs are used by the client to get events, and how best to update the spec to make recent API deprecations more clear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://matrix.org/jira/browse/SPEC-310">SPEC-310</a>: Consider renaming &quot;state key&quot; to &quot;subtype&quot; and making it optional</p>
<p>Ongoing discussion of the semantics of Matrix's &quot;state events,&quot; as well as discussion about how to balance the quality of the spec with the need to make progress on implementations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://matrix.org/jira/browse/SPEC-308">SPEC-308</a>: Authentication API is unclear/misleading</p>
<p>Ongoing discussion about how the user-interactive authentication system relates to specific API endpoints that use it, like <code>/register</code> and <code>/login</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
