    <p>Wow the summer has flown by, it feels like just yesterday I was learning how to
rebase and what exactly it is Ruma does. I exaggerate slightly, but it is a big
library with lots of public API surface. I have learned more in the last few
months than in two years of school. I have been able to observe and participate
in a project with a community growing around it, been a part of discussions
about design and best practices, given and received numerous code reviews as
well as learned the process of addressing the feedback, and working from a
specification. In short, this has been an amazing opportunity to gain 
experience in all the things that are hard to obtain in a classroom.</p>
<p>My project goal was to improve the existing macros in ruma-events-macros and
ruma-api-macros. It became clear early on that this would include some major
API changes and that improving the macros as they were was pointless without
also moving to a new public API. While improving the durability and
readability of the macro code I also rewrote entire sections to accommodate
the new design.</p>
<p>A quick overview of the Matrix protocol for reference: a client sends content
that is interpreted by the server as events. The server distributes those
events out to other clients and other servers (the server case is known as
federation). Ruma groups these events by kind Message, State, Ephemeral,
ToDevice and Basic which are represented as generic structs (<code>StateEvent&lt;C&gt;</code>).
Each event kind needs to be able to hold many different content types, for
state events there is room creation, room name, and membership events to name a
few. Using the macros, enums are generated to represent all state event
possibilities, so a variant for membership, room name, etc. These types exist
to support the core API request and response types for each endpoint that is
defined by the Matrix specification.</p>

<p>One of my personal goals was to become more familiar with git. With the help
of my mentor I now feel more confident using this tool that is so essential to
developers. I became fairly adept at merging, rebasing, and navigating all the
headaches that come with that. I learned plenty of new commands. A few
highlights: <code>cherry-pick</code> and specific uses of <code>reset</code> to avoid copy-pasting
fixes and adding more commits. I used the <code>reset</code> command to craft good
commits, splitting work into appropriate chunks. I am glad that I had the
opportunity to hone my git skills. I feel like I have accomplished my goal and
then some!</p>
<p>I am proud of the work that I have done: Being part of moving ruma-events much
closer to the <code>0.22</code> release and creating macros to generate types specific to
the Matrix specification. Working with the community that has grown around Ruma
has been rewarding and I plan on sticking around.</p>
