**Ruma** is a homeserver for [Matrix](https://matrix.org) written in the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language.
Matrix is an open specification for an online communication protocol.

**This Week in Ruma** is a weekly summary of the development of Ruma, published on Sunday nights.

## From the editor

This week I want to take a moment to talk about something personal.
My best friend, [Tamara Boyens](https://twitter.com/TamaraBoyens), passed away last Friday, January 6, after more than a year of suffering from a spine injury and various related issues.
It's been incredibly heartbreaking for everyone who loved her.
She was a friendly, lively person, and was genuinely interested in any topic you would talk to her about.
She and I talked online a lot—many hours every day, year after year.
This was especially true after we both moved away from the city where we met.
Because chatting online was the way we talked the most, we were always looking for a better chat system than what was available to us, and this was a large part of my initial motivation to get involved with Matrix and build Ruma.
I have [dedicated Ruma](https://github.com/ruma/ruma#dedication) to her memory.
I hope, once it reaches production quality, that it will help many people to strengthen their relationships and get the use out of it that Tamara and I no longer can.

And now, on with the project updates.
