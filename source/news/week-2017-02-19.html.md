## From the editor

Progress on ruma-api and ruma-client-api, converting ruma-client-api over to the new approach ruma-api is using.
After converting several of the modules using macros, I decided to take another stab at using a macros 1.1 procedural macro for automatically implementing the details of each request and response type.
The result is the new [ruma-api-derive](https://github.com/ruma/ruma-api-derive).
So far it handles only a couple of simple variations, but with some of the groundwork laid, it should be easier now to fill out the remaining functionality.
The result will be that ruma-client-api will be completely declarative, and won't have to resort to manual trait implementation for a few odd cases that didn't fit the pattern of the "macros by example" macros.
