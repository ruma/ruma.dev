**Ruma** is a homeserver for [Matrix](https://matrix.org) written in the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language.
Matrix is an open specification for an online communication protocol.
For an overview of the project, visit the [home page](/).
**This Week in Ruma** is a weekly summary of the development of Ruma, published on Sunday nights.

## From the editor

With the recent death of my friend Tamara, and moving to a new home, I haven't been able to give Ruma the attention I would've liked in the last few weeks.
The rest of the Ruma community is still helping to push things forward, and I thank them sincerely for that.
In particular, I have shared commit access to the master branch of most Ruma repositories with top contributors [mujx](https://github.com/mujx) and [farodin91](https://github.com/farodin91), both in recognition of their continued contributions to the project, the trust I have in them now, and my desire to grow the community and not be a blocker for progress on the project when I'm unavailable.
Congratulations and thank you to both of them!

We've had a lot of discussion over a major overhaul to the design of ruma-api.
The discussion began when [Simon Goller](https://github.com/neosam) proposed some code for [the first significant endpoint in ruma-client](https://github.com/ruma/ruma-client/pull/1).
It then continued in the Ruma room on Matrix, [a reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/5o89f6/optional_associated_types/), and a series of issues and pull requests against ruma-api:

* [Potential API redesign to better handle endpoints without certain kinds of parameters](https://github.com/ruma/ruma-api/issues/6)
* [Another potential API design merging the existing API with some of Ralith's ideas](https://github.com/ruma/ruma-api/pull/7)
* [Yet another potential API design using generics](https://github.com/ruma/ruma-api/pull/8)
* [Revision of the API based on Ralith's ideas. ](https://github.com/ruma/ruma-api/pull/9)

Right now we are leaning towards that last one being the one we choose, but we still want to try implementing some of ruma-client-api and ruma-client against it to see how well it works.
Feedback and participation in the discussion is most welcome!
