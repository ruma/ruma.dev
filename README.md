# ruma.dev

This repository contains the source code for the Ruma website.

It is built using the static page generator [Zola][]. If you want to work on this side, you will
first need to [install Zola](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/).
After that, just run `zola serve` and the site will be built and served on `http://localhost:1111/`.

For more information, see [Zola's documentation][ZolaDocs].
